# NREM Sleep Excitable Dynamics in Rodent Neocortex and Hippocampus

## Overview
This project investigates the excitable dynamics of NREM sleep in the rodent neocortex and hippocampus. We reimplemented and extended a Wilson-Cowan-like model to simulate and analyze UP/DOWN state dynamics, providing insights into the neural mechanisms underlying sleep-related brain activity.

## Key Features
1. **Neural Dynamics Modeling**: Implementation of a Wilson-Cowan-like model to simulate UP/DOWN state dynamics in the neocortex and hippocampus during NREM sleep.
2. **Bifurcation and Stability Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of neural dynamics, categorizing them into oscillatory, bistable, ExcitableUP, and ExcitableDOWN regimes.
3. **Quantitative Analysis**: In-depth examination of state duration distributions to understand the influence of neural drive and adaptation on UP/DOWN state dynamics.

## Results
Our analysis reveals:
- Distinct excitability regimes in the neocortex and hippocampus during NREM sleep
- Mechanisms of stability and transitions between different neural states
- Quantitative relationships between neural drive, adaptation, and UP/DOWN state dynamics
