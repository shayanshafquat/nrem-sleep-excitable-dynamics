# nrem-sleep-excitable-dynamics
This project investigates the excitable dynamics of NREM sleep in the rodent neocortex and hippocampus. We reimplemented and extended a Wilson-Cowan-like model to simulate and analyze UP/DOWN state dynamics, providing insights into the neural mechanisms underlying sleep-related brain activity.
